### introducing JS
* HTML, SCC, and js all used together to build webpages. the HTML document includes the SCC and JS files linked inside.
* JS is written in plain text just like HTML and SCC
* the **script** element is used t0 tell the browser that it is dealing with an script. the **scr** includes the js file.
* it is possible to place the js file in the **script** element, but it is better to have its own file.
