## comparsion operators:
* comparsion operators are a way to evaluate condtional statments to either True or False. There are many comparsion operators: 
    1. == means equal to
    2. != means not equal to 
    3. === means script equal to 
    4. !== means script not equal to 
    5. < means less than
    6. ->- means greater than 
    7. < means less than or equal 
    8. ->=- means greater than or equal 
## logical operators:
* logical operators are intended to evaluate the result of the comparsion operators to either True or False
    1. $$ returns True only if the two expressions evaluate to True
    2. || returns True if either expression evaluates to True. If both expressions evaluate to False, || returns False.
    3. ! It inverts values
## loops:
A loop checks a condition. As long as the condition is True, the loop keeps running. It stops once the condition evaluates to False.
### Types if loops:
    1. for loop
    2. while loop 
    3 do loop
